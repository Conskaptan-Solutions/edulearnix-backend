                <h2>1. Overview</h2>
                <p>At <strong>ConsKaptan</strong>, we aim to deliver value and clear expectations. This Refund Policy explains in which situations refunds are available, how to request one, and how we handle digital product orders, courses, and job-portal related purchases. If you purchased a product or course through a third-party provider, their refund terms may apply.</p>

                <h2>2. Scope & Definitions</h2>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Digital Products:</strong> Downloads, software keys, templates, ebooks, and other non-physical items sold through our digital store.</li>
                    <li><strong>Courses:</strong> Paid online courses, memberships, or access to course content provided by ConsKaptan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Job Listings:</strong> Job access or featured job posts. We generally do not charge end users for job listings; if a paid service applies, it will be described at purchase.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. General Refund Principles</h2>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li>We assess refund requests on a case-by-case basis and try to be fair and prompt.</li>
                    <li>We do not promise refunds in every case. Certain digital goods are non-refundable once delivered or the license/key has been issued.</li>
                    <li>Refund processing time: approved refunds are returned to the original payment method within 7–14 business days. Bank or card issuer delays may apply beyond our control.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Digital Products (Marketplace)</h2>
                <p>By default, purchases of digital products are <strong>final</strong> and non-refundable once the download link or license key is delivered. Exceptions may be considered when:</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li>The product is demonstrably defective or materially different from the description on the product page.</li>
                    <li>A duplicate payment occurred and can be verified.</li>
                    <li>There is a clear, documented failure of delivery (for example, a broken download link that we cannot repair within a reasonable time).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To request a refund for a digital product, provide your order ID, proof of purchase, and a clear explanation of the issue (screenshots or logs if relevant). We'll investigate and respond within 5 business days.</p>

                <h2>5. Courses & Memberships</h2>
                <p>For paid courses and memberships we offer the following default policy unless otherwise noted at checkout:</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>7-day refund window:</strong> You may request a full refund within 7 calendar days of purchase provided you have consumed less than 20% of the course content. Consumption is measured by course progress on our platform.</li>
                    <li>If substantial access or materials have been used, we may offer a partial refund or credit at our discretion.</li>
                    <li>Refunds will not be issued for change of mind after the 7-day window or when the course was explicitly marked as non-refundable during purchase.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Payment Failures, Duplicates & Unauthorized Charges</h2>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li>If you are charged in error (duplicate charge, or unauthorized transaction), contact us immediately. Provide the date, amount, and transaction reference.</li>
                    <li>We will review payment processor logs and may contact the payment provider. If the claim is valid, we will refund the duplicated or unauthorized amount.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>7. How to Request a Refund</h2>
                <p>Please follow these steps to request a refund:</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li>Send an email to <a href="mailto:billing@conskaptan.in" class="text-indigo-600 font-semibold hover:underline">billing@conskaptan.in</a> (or <a href="mailto:legal@conskaptan.in" class="text-indigo-600 font-semibold hover:underline">legal@conskaptan.in</a> for legal queries).</li>
                    <li>Include: order ID, purchase date, email used for purchase, and a clear description of the issue. Attach supporting documents or screenshots if applicable.</li>
                    <li>We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a case number. Expect a final decision within 5–10 business days after we receive all required information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. Refund Decisions & Partial Refunds</h2>
                <p>We evaluate requests in good faith. Outcomes may include:</p>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li>Full refund to the original payment method.</li>
                    <li>Partial refund or store credit.</li>
                    <li>Replacement product or access extension.</li>
                    <li>Refund denial with explanation and, where possible, remedial steps.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>9. Chargebacks</h2>
                <p>If you file a chargeback with your bank or card issuer before contacting us, we may be limited in how we can help. We ask that you contact us first so we can resolve the issue quickly. If a chargeback has already been filed, please still email us with the case details and we'll cooperate with your bank to resolve it. Abuse of the chargeback process may result in account suspension.</p>

                <h2>10. Third-Party Providers</h2>
                <p>If your purchase involves a third-party service (for example, an external course host, marketplace, or payment gateway), that third party's refund policy may apply in addition to ours. We'll always try to surface relevant third-party terms at checkout, but please review them before completing a purchase.</p>

                <h2>11. Exceptions & Special Circumstances</h2>
                <ul class="space-y-2">
                    <li>Promotional items, free trials, and explicitly marked non-refundable offers are excluded unless otherwise stated.</li>
                    <li>We may make exceptions for extenuating circumstances (serious illness, death in family, proven technical issues) on a case-by-case basis.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated policy on this page with a new "Last Updated" date. Continued use of our services after changes means you accept the revised policy.</p>

                <h2>13. Governing Law & Disputes</h2>
                <p>This Refund Policy is governed by the laws of India. Any disputes related to refunds will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Kolkata, West Bengal.</p>
